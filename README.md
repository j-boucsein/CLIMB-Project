This repository contains the code I am using for the CLIMB Project. The Project is set out to explore the dependency of $Ly \alpha$ spectra on the cosmological parameters and vice versa. 

For this purpose 50 simulations were run using the AREPO code, varying the cosmological parameters {$\Omega_\Lambda$, $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, h} with a boxsize of 25 Mpc and $256^3$ particles. From these boxes $Ly \alpha$ spectra were created.
