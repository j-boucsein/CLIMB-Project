Pseudocode for bash scripts:


n_particles:

loop:
- create new directory for the simulation
- copy the template stuff (Conig.sh etc)
- set parameters for IC (music) in param_music.txt file (change one line that has the num of particles)
- execute the custom_create.py and give it the absolute path to the simulation directory
- check if there is a ics file in the simulation directory
- got to the arepo directory and execute CONFIG=./run/testsims/example/Config.sh BUILD_DIR=./run/testsims/example/build EXEC=./run/testsims/example/Arepo
- check if the make was successfull and there is an executable Arepo
- go to simulation directory
- execute sbatch slurm_script.slurm

jump to start for next parameters


n_tasks:

loop:
- create new directory for the simulation
- copy the template stuff (Conig.sh etc)
- execute the custom_create.py and give it the absolute path to the simulation directory
- check if there is a ics file in the simulation directory
- got to the arepo directory and execute CONFIG=./run/testsims/example/Config.sh BUILD_DIR=./run/testsims/example/build EXEC=./run/testsims/example/Arepo
- check if the make was successfull and there is an executable Arepo
- go to simulation directory
- edit the slurm script (change one line that has the number of threads to use)
- execute sbatch slurm_script.slurm

jump to start for next parameters
